## The NZB download solution you were waiting for.

NZB Monkey makes your live much easier by supporting the
search/&zwnj;download/&zwnj;rename/&zwnj;apply process of NZB files into your
favorite download tool.

### Let's have a look to the regular process:

1. You are at your favorite download portal website.
2. Click one of the "search engine" buttons to open a NZB search engine with
   prefilled search term.
3. Hopefully the search term was unique, you see only one result. Click on download
   to get the NZB file.
4. The downloaded file is often named after the search term. So you have to rename
   it to a proper name.
5. Apply the renamed NZB file to your favorite download tool by moving it to a
   scan dir or uploading it into a web interface.
6. If necessary copy and apply a unpack password.
